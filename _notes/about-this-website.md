## Technical aspects

This website is running Jekyll, with a template by Maxime Vaillancourt. It is hosted on Netlify. The content comes straight from my Roam Research account: backup is done with [roam2github](https://github.com/everruler12/roam2github), formatting with [a fork](https://github.com/alaq/roam-to-garden) of Piotr G's roam-to-garden.

Follow my guide, if you would like to replicate this setup.

## Content

Here are all the notes in this garden, along with their links, visualized as a graph:

You can start by reading [my linklog](/vspacecode) (this is a test, for the alias, remove it)
