On this page I am detailing everything that I use consistently, and can't live without. I am taking the inspiration from [this](https://danielwirtz.com/tools).

I am only listing things that I use but also can recommend without hesitation. If it is not the case, it will not be listed here. For instance, I use a calendar application and while it's satisfying my needs, it is not giving me joy.

# Software

## Programming

[VS Code](/articles/vs-code), with the following extensions:

- [VSpaceCode](/articles/vspacecode) for keybindings. Read my article on how to never use the mouse in VS Code again, [VSpaceCode](/articles/vspacecode)

- [Calva](/articles/calva) for clojure(script)

- [edamagit](/articles/edamagit) is a port of emacs' magit, which some say is the greatest git porcelain.

- [Subliminal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gaearon.subliminal) is a theme by [Dan Abramov](/articles/dan-abramov). I has very little syntax highlighting and is quite easy on the eyes. I have not been able to find anything close to this.

## Note taking and second brain

- [Roam Research](/articles/roam-research) (web)

  - [Neuracache](/articles/neuracache) to extract flashards from Roam Research and study them

  - RoamSync is a tool that I built myself to sync events from Google Calendar with Roam Reseach 

## Reading/consuming information

Most if not all of my browsing starts in my browsing starts in my RSS feed reader. The only exception would be when someone sends me a link. For this the Feedbin with Reeder dynamic duo has been stellar. I am keeping an eye on [Readwise's upcoming reader](https://readwise.io/read) though.

- [Feedbin](/articles/feedbin) (web) with [Reeder](/articles/reeder) (iOS)

I invite you to read my article, [All of my browsing starts in my feed reader](/articles/all-of-my-browsing-starts-in-my-feed-reader) to learn more on how I use these.

- [Instapaper](/articles/instapaper) (web/iOS). Anything worth reading is saved to Instapaper.

## Keeping track

I call this the quantified self light. It's not intense, it's loosely collected data about what I do. A lot of it ends up on my calendar, automatically.

 - I keep track of where I go with Swarm, by Foursquare. I have checked into every single place that I have been to since I moved to New York.

- I keep track of what I watch on Trakt.tv (movies and tv), imdb (movies), icheckmovies (movies)

- I keep track of my runs on Strava

## Privacy

- [NextDNS](/articles/nextdns)

- [uBlock Origin](/articles/ublock-origin) (browser extension)

## Browser extensions

- [Dark Reader](/articles/dark-reader)

- [Vimium](/articles/vimium)

## Misc

- [worldtimebuddy](https://worldtimebuddy.com) to convert from one time zone to another with ease

- Wise to send money across borders. I specifically use it to send money between my US and French bank accounts.

## Hardware

- [Satechi Slim X1 keyboard](/articles/satechi-slim-x1-keyboard)

- Logitech M720 Triathlon

- Apple Watch, specifically in my case the Series 6 LTE
